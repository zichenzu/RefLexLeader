# RefLexLeader
RefLexLeader Symmetry Breaking Method


This is the implementation of the ReflexLeader method proposed in the paper "Jimmy Lee and Zichen Zhu.  Static Symmetry Breaking with the Reflex Ordering, Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-16), pages 758-765, New York City, USA, July, 2016"

Please use Gecode Solver 4.2.0 to run these files.

Put Reflex folder into gecode folder and DLS_Reflex.cpp file into example folder.

To run the Diagonal Latin Square (DLS) problem (e.g. n=6) using symmetry breaking method ReflexLeader:

./DLS_Reflex 6
